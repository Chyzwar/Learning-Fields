Problem Statement

Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q.

Input format: 
The first line contains an integer T representing the number of testcases (T <= 15) 
Each test case contains Px Py Qx Qy representing the (x,y) coordinates of P and Q, all of them being integers.

Constraints 
1 <= T <= 15 
-100 <= x, y <= 100

Output format 
For each test case output x and y coordinates of the symmetric point
